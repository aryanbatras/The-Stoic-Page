		<h2>Is your life exactly the way you want it to be?</h2>
		<h3>Without a destination, life will come to be aimless. Why is it? Do you not have time for yourself to think of what you want? Is it that you just don't know yet? You may think that you do not know what you want but you always know what you do not want. A want is always an effect of a non-want. You may not have the time to question yourself but life questions your every existence and it questions the sincerity of your desire. Sincerity does not mean wanting something. Sincerity means that you no longer have a choice and if you do not have what you want then you will die. The only reason that your life is not exactly the way you want is because you didn't really want it, and the only reason you didn't want it is because it is okay for you to be the way you are. </h3>
